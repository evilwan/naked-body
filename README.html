    <title>How to use Burpsuite extension &quot;Naked Body&quot;</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>How to use Burpsuite extension &quot;Naked Body&quot;</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>In Burp go to the &quot;Extender&quot; tab, then select the &quot;Extensions&quot; sub-tab and click &quot;Add&quot;</p>
<p>This is a Java extension, so select extension type &quot;Java&quot;</p> and as extension file, select the Jar file that comes with
this extension (e.g. <code>NakedBody-1.0.jar</code>) Accept all defaults for the extension and you are good to go.
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Go to the &quot;HTTP history&quot; sub-tab in the &quot;Proxy&quot; tab. Select one or more lines in the history and click the right mouse button. In
    the pop-up, select line &quot;Naked Body&quot; to display the save dialog of this extension.</p>
<p>Use the &quot;Browse...&quot; button to select the output directory (where to bury^H save the request/response bodies) Check or uncheck the options
to save request bodies and/or response bodies</p>
<p>Finally, click &quot;OK&quot; to actually save the selected bodies.
</p>
<p>The output filenames are built like so:</p>
<ul>
    <li>name of the selected output directory</li>
    <li>&quot;<code>/</code>&quot;</li>
    <li>timestamp of time when the &quot;OK&quot; button was clicked in the format &quot;yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;<code>-req-</code>&quot; for request bodies, &quot;<code>-resp-</code>&quot; for response bodies</li>
    <li>sequence number (starting from 1)</li>
    <li>&quot;<code>.dat</code>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><code>2019-09-12_18-10-55-req-1.dat</code><br>
<code>2019-09-12_18-10-55-req-2.dat</code><br>
<code>2019-09-12_18-10-55-resp-2.dat</code></p>
<h2>Build from source code</h2>
<p>
    The first step would be to download the source code from <a href="http://www.evilwan.be/files/naked-body-1.0.tar.gz">here</a> and extract the
    archive in a convenient place.
</p>
<p>
    If you have Maven installed, then go to the top level directory of the extracted archive and type:
</p>
<p><code>mvn package</code></p>
<p>At the end, you will find the Jar file in subdirectory <code>target/</code></p>
<p>If you do not have Maven at hand, the process is slightly more complicated. First get version 1.7.22 of the Burp extender API. If all else fails,
you could use the actual Burpsuite Jar instead of this API Jar.</p>
<p>Next, go to the subdirectory <code>src/main/java</code> of the extracted sources and compile the code by hand with something like this:</p>
<p><code>javac -cp &lt;your-burp-api.jar&gt; burp/*.java evilwan/nakedbody/*.java</code></p>
<p>followed by a packaging like this:</p>
<p><code>jar cvf your-naked-body.jar burp/*.class evilwan/nakedbody/*.class</code></p>
